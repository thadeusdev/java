/**
 * Polymorphism - means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.
 * 
 * Inheritance - lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class.
 * 
 * Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks. - this allows us to perform a single action in different ways.
