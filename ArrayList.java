/**
 * ArrayList class - is a resizable array, which can be found in the java.util package.
 * 
 * The difference between a built-in array and an ArrayList in Java, is that the size of an array cannot be modified (if you want to add or remove elements to/from an array, you have to create a new one). While elements can be added and removed from an ArrayList whenever you want. The syntax is also slightly different:
 */

// Create an ArrayList object called cars that will store strings:
import java.util.ArrayList; // import the ArrayList class

public class ArrayList {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> cars = new ArrayList<String>(); // Create an ArrayList object
    }
}
