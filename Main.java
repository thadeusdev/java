// Access Modifiers
/**
 * public - The code is accessible for all classes
 * private - The code is only accessible within the declared class
 * default - The code is only accessible in the same package. This is used when you don't specify a modifier.
 * protected - The code is accessible in the same package and subclasses
 */

// Non-access Modifiers
/**
 * final - Attributes and methods cannot be overriden/modified
 * static - Attributes and methods belongs to the class, rather than an object
 * abstract - Can only be used in an abstract class, and can only be used on methods. The method does not have a body,for example abstract void run();. The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from).
 * transient - attributes and methods are skipped when serializing the object containing them
 * synchronized - Methods vcan ony be accessed by one thread at a time
 * volatile - The value of an attribute is not cached thread-locally, and is always read from the "main memory"
